# "NSFG" Repository

This repository contains scripts and documents pertaining to analysis of the [National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm), mostly pertaining to contraception.

The strategy used to ingest NSFG data is to first load them using the provided [SAS program statements](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2017_2019_puf.htm#program) into a SAS programming environment, then to export data from the SAS programming environment via comma-separated values (CSV) files that are loaded in an R programming environment. The export from SAS includes labels and formats, the latter of which can be used to generate R factors as needed.

## Directory Structure

### SAS/

The `SAS/` subdirectory contains scripts written in the SAS statistical programming language. The `FORMAT` steps in the `DATA` steps of the program statements are commented out in order to make data exports to R compact and consistent.

### R/

The `R/` subdirectory contains scripts written in the R statistical programming language. The `import.R` script contains an helper function for loading the NSFG data in an R environment.

### data/

The `data/` subdirectory is the expected location of data files. The NSFG distributes its data in ASCII-encoded text files suffixed with ".dat", which are not checked into this repository, but can be [downloaded directly](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/ftp_dua.htm?url_redirect=ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/NSFG). The comma-separated CSV files checked into this directory are the result of exports from a SAS programming environment using scripts contained in the `SAS/` subdirectory.

### eda/

The `eda/` subdirectory contains R Markdown files that summarize exploratory analysis. These are not formal reports as much as they are real-time records of analysis as the analysis is done.

### reports/

The `reports/` subdirectory contains R Markdown files that are intended for some form of publication.
