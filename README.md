# "NSFG" Repository

This repository contains scripts and documents pertaining to analysis of the [National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm), mostly pertaining to contraception and related matters.


## Directory Structure

### data/

The `data/` subdirectory is the expected location of data files. The NSFG distributes its data in ASCII-encoded text files suffixed with ".dat". They are not checked into this repository, but can [downloaded directly](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/NSFG/).

### eda/

The `eda/` subdirectory contains R Markdown files that summarize exploratory analysis. These are not formal reports as much as they are real-time records of analysis as the analysis is done.
