# Things to Do

* Collect estimates into coherent report
* Review situations in which universes do not match specifications in codebooks and follow up with NSFG administrators
* Compare own report with published reports
* Look into what it takes to publish in an academic journal
* Replicate analysis in SAS
    * Attempt single-factor categorical data analysis, e.g., whether totals of otherwise not using contraception and currently trying to conceive are different
