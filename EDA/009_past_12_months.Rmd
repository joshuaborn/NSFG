# Otherwise Did Not Use Contraception at Last Intercourse

Generally, a sizable minority of unintentional nonusers have used a method of contraception at least once in the past 12 months, and a supermajority of female nonusers have used a method of contraception at least once in their lifetimes, so there is some evidence that at least a portion of unintentional nonuse is due to inconsistent use, rather than strict nonuse.


## Used Contraception in Past 12 Months

```{r, dependson=c('male-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(
      PXANYUSE == 'Yes' |
      PXANYUSE2 == 'Yes' |
      PXANYUSE3 == 'Yes' |
      CWPRECBC == 'Yes'
    ),
    subset(
      male_2017_2019_svy,
      curr_use == 'Otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse'
    ),
    svyciprop
  ),
  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'males who otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse',
  title = 'who used at least one method of contraception in the past 12 months with most recent partner'
) |> kable()
```

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(ANYBC12 == 'Yes, at least one month of method use'),
    subset(
      fem_2017_2019_svy,
      curr_use == 'Otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse'
    ),
    svyciprop
  ),
  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'females who otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse',
  title = 'who used at least one method of contraception in the past 12 months'
) |> kable()
```


## Has Ever Used Contraception

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(EVERUSED == 'Yes'),
    subset(
      fem_2017_2019_svy,
      curr_use == 'Otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse'
    ),
    svyciprop
  ),
  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'females who otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse',
  title = 'who have had sexual intercourse only that one time'
) |> kable()
```

I can't find an equivalent to `EVERUSED` for males.


## Used Contraception at First Intercourse with Most Recent Partner

```{r, dependson=c('male-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(PXFUSE == 'Yes'),
    subset(
      male_2017_2019_svy,

    ),
    svyciprop

  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'males who otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse',
  title = 'who used at least one method of contraception in the past 12 months with most recent partner'
) |> kable()
```


## Last Intercourse Was First Intercourse with Partner

```{r, dependson=c('male-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(PXMTONCE == 'Yes'),
    subset(
      male_2017_2019_svy,
      curr_use == 'Otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse'
    ),
    svyciprop
  ),
  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'males who otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse',
  title = 'whose last intercourse was first intercourse with partner'
) |> kable()
```


## Has Not Had Sexual Intercourse More Than Once

```{r, dependson=c('male-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(SEXONCE == 'YES (R HAS HAD SEX ONLY ONCE)'),
    subset(
      male_2017_2019_svy,

  ),
  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'females who otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse',
  title = 'who have had sexual intercourse only that one time'
) |> kable()
```


# Any Contraceptive Use in Past 12 Months

## Had Intercourse with Opposite Sex in Past 12 Months

```{r, dependson=c('male-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(SEX12MO != 'YES, HAD INTERCOURSE'),
    male_2017_2019_svy,
    svytotal
  )[level == TRUE],
  type = 'total',
  domain = 'males aged 15-49 living in households in the United States',

  type = 'total',
  domain = 'females aged 15-49 living in households in the United States',
  title = 'who have not had intercourse with a male in the past 12 months'
) |> kable()
```


## Did Not Use Contraception in Past 12 Months

```{r, dependson=c('male-process-data')}
male_2017_2019_data[
  SEX12MO == 'YES, HAD INTERCOURSE',
  .(PXANYUSE, PXANYUSE3, CWPRECBC)

      PXANYUSE != 'Yes' &
      PXANYUSE2 != 'Yes' &
      PXANYUSE3 != 'Yes' &
      CWPRECBC != 'Yes'
    ),

  type = 'total',
  domain = 'males who have had intercourse with a female in the past 12 months',
  title = 'who have not used contraception in the past 12 months'
) |> kable()
```

The universe of the `PXANYUSE` series and `CWPRECBC` does not appear to be all males who have had intercourse in past 12 months.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(

# Things to Investigate

* Summarize contraceptive use in previous 12 months by those not sexually active with opposite sex, by those sexually active and did not use contraception at all, and by contraceptive method among those who used at least one method of contraception
* Among those sexually active with the opposite sex in the previous 12 months and who used at least one method of contraception, how frequently was any method of contraception used?
* Among those who used condoms in previous 12 months, how frequently were condoms used, in the past 12 months and past 4 weeks?
* Among females who used the pill in the previous 12 months, how many pills were missed?
* Can the difference in female and male contraceptive use rates be due to males not being aware of contraception?
* Among those at risk for unintended pregnancy, why not using contraception (Fem: EH-2, Male: None)
* Why respondents believe themselves to be sterile (Fem: DE-2 REASIMPP & EH-2 WHYNOTPG, Male: None)
* Ever tried over lifetime and why quit (Fem: EA, DC; Male: BB)
    * Include tubal ligation and vasectomy reversal
* Replicate analysis in SAS
    * Attempt single-factor categorical data analysis, e.g., whether totals of otherwise not using contraception and currently trying to conceive are different
* Combining with 2015-2017 data for more precise estimates
* Nonresponse bias by comparing second phase vs. first-phase


## Variables for Recent Contraceptive Use

* Each month for 3 previous years
    * Females
        * EC MONSX whether intercourse occurred in given month
        * ED METHX each method used in each month
        * ED SIMSEQX whether methods used together or at different times
* Past 12 months
    * Females
        * EL for frequency of condom or any contraceptive use and missed pills (also past 4 weeks)
    * Males
        * BC overall frequency of sexual intercourse and condom use (also past 4 weeks)
        * CF methods used with current wife or cohabitating partner and "most often" used method
        * DG methods used with most recent 3 partners, "main" method, and frequency of condom and any method use
