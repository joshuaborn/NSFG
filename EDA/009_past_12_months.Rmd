# Otherwise Did Not Use Contraception at Last Intercourse


## Used Contraception in Past 12 Months

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(ANYBC12 == 'Yes, at least one month of method use'),

  title = 'who used at least one method of contraception in the past 12 months'

```

For females, a sizable minority of unintentional female nonusers have used a method of contraception at least once in the past 12 months.


## Has Ever Used Contraception

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(

  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'females who otherwise did not use contraception at last intercourse',
  title = 'who have had sexual intercourse only that one time'

```

A supermajority of female nonusers have used a method of contraception at least once in their lifetimes

I can't find an equivalent to `EVERUSED` for males.

```

The universe of the `PXANYUSE` series and `CWPRECBC` does not appear to be all males who have had intercourse in past 12 months. I see. The `PXANYUSE` series is only asked of a respondent if he did not report using contraception at either last or first sex with the partner in question. Similarly, `CWPRECBC` is only asked of a respondent if he reports not using contraception at either last or first sex with current wife or cohabitating partner or of both those were longer ago than past 12 months.

Thus, it's better to estimate any contraception used in past 12 months first, then estimate the remaining nonusers. This is relatively straightforward for females, but for males care must be taken to check, for each possible partner, use at first intercourse and whether first intercourse was within past 12 months, use at last sex and whether last intercourse was within 12 months, and otherwise use within 12 months.

# Things to Investigate

* Summarize contraceptive use in previous 12 months by those not sexually active with opposite sex, by those sexually active and did not use contraception at all, and by contraceptive method among those who used at least one method of contraception
* Among those sexually active with the opposite sex in the previous 12 months and who used at least one method of contraception, how frequently was any method of contraception used?
* Among those who used condoms in previous 12 months, how frequently were condoms used, in the past 12 months and past 4 weeks?
* Among females who used the pill in the previous 12 months, how many pills were missed?
* Can the difference in female and male contraceptive use rates be due to males not being aware of contraception?
* Among those at risk for unintended pregnancy, why not using contraception (Fem: EH-2, Male: None)
* Why respondents believe themselves to be sterile (Fem: DE-2 REASIMPP & EH-2 WHYNOTPG, Male: None)
* Ever tried over lifetime and why quit (Fem: EA, DC; Male: BB)
    * Include tubal ligation and vasectomy reversal
* Replicate analysis in SAS
    * Attempt single-factor categorical data analysis, e.g., whether totals of otherwise not using contraception and currently trying to conceive are different
* Experiment using chi-squared tests whether it is worth combining with 2015-2017 data for more precise estimates


## Variables for Recent Contraceptive Use

* Each month for 3 previous years
    * Females
        * EC MONSX whether intercourse occurred in given month
        * ED METHX each method used in each month
        * ED SIMSEQX whether methods used together or at different times
* Past 12 months
    * Females
        * ED whether specific methods were used in past 12 months
        * EL for frequency of condom or any contraceptive use and missed pills (also past 4 weeks)
    * Males
        * BC overall frequency of sexual intercourse and condom use (also past 4 weeks)
        * CF methods used with current wife or cohabitating partner and "most often" used method
        * DG methods used with most recent 3 partners, "main" method, and frequency of condom and any method use
