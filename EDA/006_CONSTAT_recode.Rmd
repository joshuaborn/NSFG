    level = V1

```

# Overall

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~CONSTAT1,
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal,
  ordered = FALSE
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

# Using Contraception

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(as.integer(CONSTAT1) %in% 1:22),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal,
  ordered = FALSE
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

# Not Sexually Active

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(as.integer(CONSTAT1) %in% 31:32),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal,
  ordered = FALSE
)[level == TRUE] |> in_millions() |> kable()
```


# Discrepancies

## Not Sexually Active

There is a big discrepancy between the number of sexually inactive females reported here (21.361) and what is estimated by `CONSTAT1` (12.236) million.

Here only females who have had sexual intercourse in the previous 3 months are counted as using contraception. By `CONSTAT1` logic, any females who have had contraceptive sterilizing operations are assigned a `CONSTAT1` value of `01` "Female sterilization."

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    FECUND == 1 &
    STRLOPER %in% 1:2
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

This accounts for 2 million females of the difference in the estimates.

Likewise, all pregnant females are given a `CONSTAT1` of `30`, regardless of whether they are sexually active.


```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    RCURPREG == 'YES (CURRENTLY PREGNANT)'
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

This only accounts for aabout 0.195 million females of the difference in the estimates.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    !is.element(CONSTAT1, 40:41)
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

More generally, though, all of the females who have not had sexual intercourse in the previous 3 months, but who are given a `CONSTAT1` value not `40` or `41` amount to about 9.208 million females. The difference in the estimates is $21.361 - 12.236$ or $9.125$ million females. Thus, this accounts for the difference in the estimates.


## To Do

* Compare estimates for females against `CONSTAT1`; see recode specification
    * Pill is more for `CONSTAT1` 10.139 vs 7.947
    * Implant 1.459 vs 1.161
    * Injectable 1.423 vs 1.041
    * Nonsurgical sterile female 1.861 vs 0.369
    * Other nonuser had intercourse in the 3 months prior to interview 5.081 vs 3.917
* Go over outline and adjust


# Outline

## Frames for analysis

### By Table

* Female persons
* Male persons

### By Columns

* "Current" -- at last intercourse with male in past 3 months
* "Recent" -- over previous year
* "Ever" -- over lifetime

## Questions for Users

* Which contraceptives?
* How many?
* For reasons other than contraception?
* For "recent," how consistent?
* For "recent" and for multiple methods users, simultaneously or alternatively?
* For "ever" and who have stopped using a method, why did they stop?

## Questions for Nonusers

* Not sexually active with male?
    * Ever or just now?
    * Exclusively same-sex partner(s)?
* Currently pregnant?
* Noncontraceptive surgical sterilization
* Physically unable to have child
* Cohabitating partner or husband surgical sterilization
* Cohabitating partner or husband physically unable to have child
* Trying to get pregnant?
* For those fertile, heterosexually active, not using contraception, and not desiring pregnancy, why no contraception usage?

## Covariates/Subdomains

* Want children in future, but not just not now
* By sex education
* By income
* By religion
    * Roman Catholics are a subdomain of interest.
* Second phase vs. first-phase (to investigate nonresponse bias)

## Other

* Try combining with 2015-2017 data for more precise estimates?
