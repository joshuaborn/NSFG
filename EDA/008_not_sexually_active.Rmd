# Things to Investigate

* Extract helpers
* Among those at risk for unintended pregnancy, why not using contraception
* Why respondents believe themselves to be sterile
* Ever tried over lifetime and why quit
* Time periods of contraceptive use for unintended pregnancy detection and efficacy/failure rate estimation
* Consistency
* Replicate analysis in SAS
    * Attempt single-factor categorical data analysis, e.g., whether totals of otherwise not using contraception and currently trying to conceive are different
* Combining with 2015-2017 data for more precise estimates
* Nonresponse bias by comparing second phase vs. first-phase

## Covariates/Subdomains

* Want children in future, but not just not now
* By sex education
* By income
* By religiosity
