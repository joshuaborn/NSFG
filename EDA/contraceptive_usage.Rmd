It seems like the NSFG recodes count a respondent as currently using contraception if has had sexual intercourse in the past 3 months with someone of the opposite sex and used a contraceptive during the last intercourse.

```{r}
tablena(fem_data$HADSEX)
tablena(fem_data$SEX3MO)
tablena(fem_data$SEXP3MO)
tablena(fem_data$MTHUSE3)
kable(fem_data[, sum(is.na(HADSEX), is.na(MTHUSE3))])
```

Togther the above variables form a set. Those who have `2` for `HADSEX` are `NA` for `SEX3MO`, and those who have either a `2` for `HADSEX` or `2` for `SEX3MO` are `NA` for `MTHUSE3`.

There is another variable `SEXP30MO` which comes from the months of non-intercourse series that reports a higher count of those who have had sex in the past 3 months than `SEX3MO`.

```{r}
kable(fem_formats[startsWith(column_name, 'MTHUSE3F')])

fem_data[, MTHUSE3F := factorize(MTHUSE3, 'MTHUSE3F', fem_formats)]
fem_data[, woman := 1]

ksvytotalci(~woman, fem_svy)

ksvybyci(~woman, ~MTHUSE3F, fem_svy, svytotal)

ksvyci(~MTHUSE3F, fem_svy, svymean)
```

* Rename "column_name" in formats to "format_name"
* Try combining with 2015-2017 data for more precise estimates
* Check estimate of number of women aged 15-49 against census counts
* For those using contraception,
    * Which?
    * One or multiple?
    * Partner also using contraception?
    * Changed over lifetime?
    * Want children in future, just not now?
    * For other reasons than contraception?
    * How consistent?
* Count how many typically use contraception, e.g., in past 12 months, but missed last intercourse
* For those not using contraception,
    * Not sexually active?
        * Ever or just now?
    * Currently pregnant?
    * Trying to get pregnant?
    * (Naturally) infertile?
    * Exclusively same-sex partner(s)?
* For those fertile, heterosexually active, not using contraception, and not desiring pregnancy, why no contraception usage?
    * Attitude?
* Attitudes toward contraception more generally
* Whether second phase samples differ from first-phase (to investigate nonresponse bias)
* Subdomains
    * Roman Catholics
