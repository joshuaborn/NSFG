## Female Persons Aged 15-49

```{r, load-data}
fem_2017_2019 <- load_NSFG_data('2017_2019', 'FemResp')
fem_data <- fem_2017_2019$Data
fem_formats <- fem_2017_2019$Formats
```

```{r, setup-data}
fem_svy <- svydesign(
  ids = ~SECU,
  strata = ~SEST,
  data = fem_data,
  nest = TRUE,
  weights = ~WGT2017_2019
)
```

```{r}
kable(fem_formats[format_name == 'CONSTATF'])
```

It seems like the NSFG recodes count a respondent as currently using contraception if has had sexual intercourse in the past 3 months with someone of the opposite sex and used a contraceptive during the last intercourse.

```{r}
tablena(fem_data$HADSEX)
tablena(fem_data$SEX3MO)
tablena(fem_data$SEXP3MO)
tablena(fem_data$MTHUSE3)
fem_data[, sum(is.na(HADSEX), is.na(MTHUSE3))]
```

Togther the above variables form a set. Those who have `2` for `HADSEX` are `NA` for `SEX3MO`, and those who have either a `2` for `HADSEX` or `2` for `SEX3MO` are `NA` for `MTHUSE3`.

There is another variable `SEXP30MO` which comes from the months of non-intercourse series that reports a higher count of those who have had sex in the past 3 months than `SEX3MO`.

```{r}
fem_data[, women := 1]

ksvytotalci(~women, fem_svy)
```

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement, 2019, Table 1. Population by Age and Sex: 2019. The female civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States is ~74,445,000. The estimate generated from the NSFG is consistent with this.

```{r}
kable(fem_formats[startsWith(format_name, 'MTHUSE3F')])

fem_data[, MTHUSE3F := factorize(MTHUSE3, 'MTHUSE3F', fem_formats)]

ksvybyci(~women, ~MTHUSE3F, fem_svy, svytotal)

ksvyci(~MTHUSE3F, fem_svy, svymean)
```

```{r, females-currently-totals}
fem_data[, currently := factor(
  fifelse(
    !is.na(MTHUSE3) & MTHUSE3 == 1,
    'Currently using contraception',
    'Not currently using contraception'
  )
)]

totals <- svybyci(~women, ~currently, fem_svy, svytotal)

totals[, 2:5] <- totals[, 2:5] / 10^6

ggplot(
  data = totals,
  mapping = aes(
    x = currently
  )
) +
  geom_point(
    aes(
      y = women
    ),
    size = 5
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      xend = currently,
      y = `2.5 %`,
      yend = `97.5 %`
    ),
    size = 1
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(suffix = 'M', accuracy = 1),
    minor_breaks = \(limits) seq(floor(limits[1]), limits[2], 1)
  ) +
  labs(
    y = 'Number of females'
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank()
  )
```

```{r}
fem_data[, tablena(METH3M1)]
fem_data[, tablena(METH3M2)]
fem_data[, tablena(METH3M3)]
fem_data[, tablena(METH3M4)]
fem_data[, tablena(LSTMTHP1)]
fem_data[, tablena(LSTMTHP2)]
fem_data[, tablena(LSTMTHP3)]
fem_data[, tablena(LSTMTHP4)]
fem_data[, tablena(LSTMTHP5)]
```

It appears that no women reported using more than 3 methods of contraception at last intercourse with last partner. (`LSTMTHP5` refers to 2nd-to-last partner.)


## To Do

* Currently
    * For those using contraception,
        * Which?
        * One or multiple?
        * Together or different times?
        * Partner also using contraception?
        * Changed over lifetime?
        * Want children in future, just not now?
        * For other reasons than contraception?
        * How consistent?
    * Count how many typically use contraception, e.g., in past 12 months, but missed last intercourse
    * For those not using contraception,
        * Not sexually active?
            * Ever or just now?
        * Currently pregnant?
        * Trying to get pregnant?
        * (Naturally) infertile?
        * Exclusively same-sex partner(s)?
    * For those fertile, heterosexually active, not using contraception, and not desiring pregnancy, why no contraception usage?
        * Attitude?
* Ever used
* Attitudes toward contraception more generally
* Whether second phase samples differ from first-phase (to investigate nonresponse bias)
* Subdomains
    * Roman Catholics
* Try combining with 2015-2017 data for more precise estimates


## Male Persons Aged 15-49

```{r, load-male-data}
male_2017_2019 <- load_NSFG_data('2017_2019', 'Male')

male_data <- male_2017_2019$Data
```

```{r, setup-male-data}
male_svy <- svydesign(
  ids = ~SECU,
  strata = ~SEST,
  data = male_data,
  nest = TRUE,
  weights = ~WGT2017_2019
)
```

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, ibid. The number of civilian noninstitutionalized male persons in the United States is ~74,238,000.
